# hello-world

Hello mates,

My name is Pedro Henrique Rincon Santos and I'm a 15 year old brazilian hobbyist/student of computer science and software engineering,
I know intermediate-advanced python and intermediate C#, I also know to use Unity (The game engine) but i'm not exceptional or anything,
I plan to use github to study or even write code, because I really would like to learn more about networking and libraries like DJango and Mysql in Python.
